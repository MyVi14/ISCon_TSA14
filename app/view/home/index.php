        <h1> Welcome to Independent Study Contract (ISC) Portal</h1>

        <div id="primary_region">
            <p>An Independent Study Contract (ISC) allows a Murdoch University student to 
                study a topic or subject of personal interest which is not otherwise available 
                as a formal unit, and to obtain credit for this towards his or her course. 
                It differs from formal units in that it relies on independent study rather than formal classes, 
                and on the initiative of the student to choose and define the topic. 
                In conjunction with the academic supervisor, the student is required to structure 
                the content to be studied and the method of assessment.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in pursuing an ISC it is important to read the 
                following three documents before filling in the application form:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" class="" shape="rect" href="https://goto.murdoch.edu.au/policy/ISC">ISC Policy</a> * (pdf format)</li>
